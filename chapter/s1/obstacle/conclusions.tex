\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ob_conclusion}
In this chapter, the utility of the deep reinforcement learning framework for robot obstacle avoidance is proved under end-to-end training.
The framework comprises two parts, convolutional neural networks for feature representations and fully-connected networks for decision making. We initialized the weights of the convolutional networks by a previously trained model based on our previous work \cite{tai2016deep}. The deep reinforcement learning model extends the cognitive ability of mobile robots for more complicated indoor environments in an efficient online-learning process continuously.
Analysis of receptive fields indicates the crucial promotion of end-to-end deep reinforcement learning: the feature representations extracted by convolutional networks are motivated substantially for the traversability of mobile robots both in simulated and real environments.
