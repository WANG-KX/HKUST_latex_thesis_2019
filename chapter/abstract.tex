Every copy of the thesis must have an English abstract. Abstracts must provide a concise summary of the thesis in \textbf{300 words or less}.

Theses should be written in English. Students in the School of Humanities and Social Science who are pursuing research work in the areas of Chinese Studies, and who can demonstrate a need to use Chinese to write their theses should seek prior approval from the School via their thesis supervisor and the divisional head. If approval is granted, students are also required to produce a translation of the title page, authorization page, signature page, table of contents and the abstract of thesis in English.

(1)A thesis should be presented in a permanent and legible form either in original typescript, or a comparably permanent process.
(2)Paper and print quality are vitally important for legibility. Normally, international size A4 (297mm x 210mm) 80 to 90 gsm woodfree white paper of good quality should be used for the thesis. Exceptionally, paper other than international A4 size may be used when the nature of the thesis requires it. Any thesis not typed or printed on the correct size of paper will not be accepted.
(3)The final thesis copies should be printed on both sides of the paper.
(4)A conventional font, size 12-point, 10 to 12 characters per inch must be used. One-and-a-half line spacing should be used throughout the thesis, except for abstracts, indented quotations or footnotes where single line spacing may be used.
(4)All margins should be consistently 25mm (or at a maximum of 30mm) in width. The same margins should be used throughout a thesis. Exceptionally, margins of a different size may be used when the nature of the thesis requires it.
