In this thesis, we have considered sensorimotor learning for ground robot navigation. We targeted to find an efficient pipeline to learn and deploy cognitive navigation policies in unstructured, unfamiliar, and dynamic environments.

In general, research on sensorimotor learning is rapidly developing.
In this thesis, we explored the sensorimotor learning from both theoretical and practice perspectives and deployed various learning-based navigation policy from different sensors for the first time, in both indoor and outdoor environments and both real and simulated worlds.
To realize the target of \textit{living with robots} and allowing the robot to achieve \textit{human-like behavior}, sensorimotor learning will be expected to tackle various scenarios that we have not met before.
