# HKUST thesis latex template for PhD and MPhil, especially for ECE, 2019.

This is the latex template for HKUST based on the [RPG HandBook](https://rpghandbook.ust.hk/appendices-guidelines-on-thesis-preparation). A sample page can be found [here](http://pg.ust.hk/guides_n_forms/students/thesis_sample_page_phd.pdf).

The main revision on previous repo, like [Cheedoong/hkust-latex-thesis](https://github.com/Cheedoong/hkust-latex-thesis), is the new signature page requirement from the ECE department which can be found in [here](http://course.ece.ust.hk/pginfo/PG_Info_PDF/thesis_sample_page_PhD.PDF). The thesis examination committee list is defined as a table in [chapter/signature.tex](chapter/signature.tex).


Please choose your degree (PhD/MPhill) and uncomment the coadvisor line, if you have a coadvisor, in [main.tex](main.tex).

To compile the thesis:
